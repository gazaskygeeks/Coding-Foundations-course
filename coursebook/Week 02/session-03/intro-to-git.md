# What Is GitHub ?


### Let's start with simple words that everyone understands,What is Git? :computer:

 - Is it a programming language? - :negative_squared_cross_mark:
 - Is it a database? - :negative_squared_cross_mark:
 - Is it an operating system? - :negative_squared_cross_mark:
 - I was wondering what is git doing? So what is Git? What exactly is his job?

To understand what it is, we must first understand the problem that led to its existence, take this as a simple example, to get it.

### ✤ The problem :confused:

You are working on a big project as programmer, and you works on it for along time, and you really made progress, during working on it, suddenly found your self with trouble, you wrote function that made a messy in your code, and you wish that you can undo or knowing where exactly the project work successfully. So you think you are smart enough to not fall in this problem again.

You starts create a folder for your project, and give it a name, date and time.
And you will make an another copy, every time you add new feature. And this will help you to find any copy you want.

After a while, the project became bigger, and sometimes you forget to create a new folder and after all it will be many folders and you will not know which one is working perfect and has the specific feature that you want.
You will waste time and effort to know which one.

### ✤ So, the solution is
 version control system
## What is version control system (VCS)?
Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.[1]

Version control systems (VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but may also be embedded in various types of software, including integrated development environments (IDEs).

### Discussion
Version control implements a systematic approach to recording and managing changes in files. At its simplest, version control involves taking ‘snapshots’ of your file at different stages. This snapshot records information about when the snapshot was made, and also about what changes occurred between different snapshots. This allows you to ‘rewind’ your file to an older version. From this basic aim of version control, a range of other possibilities is made available.

#### Version control allows you to:

- Track developments and changes in your files
- Record the changes you made to your file in a way that you will be able to understand later
- Experiment with different versions of a file while maintaining the original version
- ‘Merge’ two versions of a file and manage conflicts between versions
- Revert changes, moving ‘backward’ through your history to previous versions of your file.

Version control is particularly useful for facilitating collaboration. One of the original motivations behind version control systems was to allow different people to work on large projects together. Using version control to collaborate allows for a greater deal of flexibility and control than many other solutions. As an example, it would be possible for two people to work on a file at the same time and then merge these together. If there were ‘conflicts’ between the two versions, the version control system would allow you to see these conflicts and make an active decision about how to ‘merge’ these different versions into a new ‘third’ document. With this approach you would also retain a ‘history’ of the previous version should you wish to revert back to one of these later on.

Popular version control systems include:

- Git
- Helix VCS
- Microsoft Team Foundation Server
- Subversion

### The following focuses on using the Git version control system.

#### what is Git?

 Git is a Version Control System for tracking changes in computer files.
* **Distributed version control** (**decentralized**): Many developers can work on the single project without having to be on the same network.
* **Coordinate work between multiple developers**:
* **Who made what changes and when**
* **Revert back at any time**
* **Local and remote repositories**
**What is repository?**
We have two types of repos; local which is on our computer and remote which is hosted on somebody's else server or computer.
The purpose of a remote repository (eg, **GitHub**) is to publish your code to the world or to some people and allow them to read or write it, so if you are the only developer, you don't really need a remote/central repo.
